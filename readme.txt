This is a gamepad module switching script intended for use with the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller in conjunction with the xboxdrv application. It is recommended that it be used as an alias. 

To permanently add an alias add the following line to ~/.bash_aliases (if the file does not exist, simply create one) and substitute the name and path as necessary: 

alias <name_of_alias>="cd /path/to/this/folder && ./game.sh && cd -"
